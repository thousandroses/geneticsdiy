# Genetics DIY Project

A Project for creating genetic visualizations. See full blogpost here: https://medium.com/@thousandroses420/tutorial-launch-your-personal-genomics-cloud-app-in-15-min-aws-genetics-python-ml-b0d1540e6e70

## Deployment of pre-built code

You're probably here from the Medium blog post. To deploy the pre-built code, follow the instructions from the blog-post from Section 4 of the blog-post onward, but instead
of referencing your own Docker Hub repo, use the following 'Docker Hub URL': https://hub.docker.com/r/thousandroses/diy:geneticsdiy. You will still need the AWS credentials, as well as the input files (see inputs folder of this repo). If you want to use your own 23andMe data, replace the 23andMe.txt with your own file (with the same name).

Have fun!
